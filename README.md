# learnProject

This is my simple chat project, which I wrote during Java course.

It is my first programm, and it cosists of

  - Client
  - Server
 
It is very raw code, so I'll continue to work with it.

I study Java on this site:
[GEEK Brains](https://geekbrains.ru/) on the course "Java-developer"

This learnProject is a result of second part "Java 2.Pro"
